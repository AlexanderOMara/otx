otx
===
Another otx fork, maintained primarily for my own use on modern OS X versions. Currently compatible with OS X 10.9 Mavericks, but may work with older versions.

Installation
------------
1. Mount otx.dmg for the prebuilt binaries or build from source.
2. Copy otx to /usr/local/bin/
3. Copy otx.app to /Applications/
